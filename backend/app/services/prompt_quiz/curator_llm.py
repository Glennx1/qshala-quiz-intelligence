"""Gemini-powered Quiz Master Curator for the prompt-quiz engine.

Strict separation of concerns:
This module NEVER writes, invents, or synthesizes question text or answers.
It ONLY receives candidate question summaries retrieved from the verified Question Vault,
evaluates them against the user's prompt (nuance, tone, audience psychology, lateral themes),
and selects the best subset and sequence for an engaging tournament/classroom round.

Failsafe guarantee:
If Gemini is unavailable, times out (> 4.0s), or returns any invalid IDs, it returns None,
and engine.py falls back instantly to the deterministic editor (BM25 + difficulty ramp).

    "CRITICAL RULES:\n"
    "1. ZERO HALLUCINATIONS: You MUST select IDs EXCLUSIVELY from the provided candidate pool. Never invent or hallucinate an ID.\n"
    "2. TOPIC RELEVANCE & HONESTY (ABSOLUTE PRIORITY):\n"
    "   - Only select questions that GENUINELY match the user's specific requested topic and intent.\n"
    "   - If the candidate pool contains genuine matches (even if only 2, 3, or 5 exist in the vault), YOU MUST SELECT ALL OF THEM in selected_ids! Never return [] when valid matches exist.\n"
    "   - Do NOT force-fit completely unrelated trivia (e.g. car factories or corporate accounting) just to fill a count. Deliver all authentic matches found.\n"
    "3. HIGH-ORDER HUMAN CURATION:\n"
    "   - Look beyond surface keywords. Match the user's requested tone, audience psychology, and subtle themes.\n"
    "   - When an audience like 'school students' or 'kids' in India is requested, prioritize inspiring figures, scientists, space pioneers, educators, national icons, and achievers that school students study, relate to, and find educational, rather than adult corporate finance, tax avoidance, or adult satire.\n"
    "   - Build a narrative arc: start with an engaging icebreaker/hook, explore the theme with increasing depth, and finish with a memorable climax or tie-breaker.\n"
    "4. DIVERSITY & ZERO DUPLICATE ENTITIES (Crucial):\n"
    "   - NEVER select two questions that ask about or have the same answer/entity (e.g. do NOT pick two questions about Dadabhai Naoroji, or two about Ramanujan).\n"
    "   - Every selected question must feature a distinct person, mission, invention, or concept.\n"
    "5. Output JSON strictly adhering to the schema."
