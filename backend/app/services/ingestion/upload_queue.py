"""Serial upload queue for deck ingestion.

Goal: let a user drop several decks and have them processed one at a time, over time, without
breaking the site. On a 512 MB host, processing decks in parallel is what causes OOM crashes, so the
whole point here is that exactly ONE deck ingests at a time.

How it works
------------
- Upload endpoints call `enqueue_upload()` instead of running the pipeline inline. That inserts an
  `IngestionJob` (source_type=MANUAL_UPLOAD, status=PENDING) and marks the Document `QUEUED`. The
  HTTP request returns immediately.
- A single background worker (`run_worker_loop`, started once at app startup) polls for the oldest
  PENDING job and runs the modern `IngestionPipeline` on it — but only when no MANUAL_UPLOAD job is
  already PROCESSING, so concurrency is capped at 1 across the whole app even if several worker
  loops exist.
- Each job gets its own short-lived DB sessions; the worker never holds a transaction across the
  pipeline run (the pipeline manages its own session).
- A job left PROCESSING by a crash/restart is reconciled on startup: marked FAILED with a clear
  message (never silently re-run, which would duplicate slides). A deliberate retry purges the
  deck's partial artifacts first (see `purge_artifacts`) and re-queues.

This path drives the current `IngestionPipeline.run()`, not the older serverless JobQueueService.
