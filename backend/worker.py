"""Standalone ingestion worker (QShala priority plan: ingestion split out of the API monolith).

Runs ONE document's ingestion pipeline to completion, then exits. Meant to run as a Cloud Run
Job execution -- each execution processes exactly one deck, triggered by job_trigger.py from the
API service, which passes which document to process as the DOCUMENT_ID env var (a per-execution
container override, not a static env var on the Job resource itself).

Usage:
    DOCUMENT_ID=<uuid> python -m backend.worker          # how Cloud Run Jobs invokes it
    python -m backend.worker <uuid>                       # CLI arg, for local testing

This does NOT change how the API service processes uploads by default -- INGESTION_MODE stays
"in_process" unless explicitly set to "cloud_run_job" (see config.py and job_trigger.py). This
file is simply unreachable/unused in the default configuration.
